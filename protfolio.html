            <p><b>E-Commerce website</b> created using html,css and js and in backhand i have used <b>Django</b> Database. Because it is quite easy and my internship is also based on this.</p>
            <p>Its name is <b>E-trends Collections</b>.It consist of all the thing that a E-Commerce website required. In backhand login and password details are in encrypted form which increases its security. You can perform all the activity like all other websites have.</p>

            <img src="project2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <h3>Learning Websites</h3>
            <p>Its name is <b>Learners 24x7</b> and i have created it for my study. Whenever i have to study any other languages i have to go for other sites for other language. So, I finally decided that why to go any where lets make a site and connect it with the other websites according to languages which i have to learn and form where i have to learn.
            This is not properly completed but i will complete it soon.</p>
